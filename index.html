    <p>
      Barby is a barcode generator for Ruby.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is highly flexible; it's easy to add or change the parts
      you need to make it work for you. There are two main components: there is the part
      responsible for generating the barcodes themselves, including all logic such as
      checksums and conversion of characters into "bars and spaces". The other main part is
      the one responsible for generating graphical (or other) representations of these
      barcodes. Separating these two makes it easy to add to one without affecting the other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let me show you how this works:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="ruby">require 'barby'
require 'barby/barcode/code_128'
require 'barby/outputter/png_outputter'

barcode = Barby::Code128.new('The noise of mankind has become too much')
File.open('code128.png', 'w'){|f|
  f.write barcode.to_png(:height =&gt; 20, :margin =&gt; 5)
}</code></pre>

    <img src="code128b.png" alt="Code 128 example" class="barcode" />

    <p>
      In this example, a Code128 barcode is created. It then uses an "outputter"
      which uses the "png" gem to generate a PNG representation of the barcode and writes this
      to a file, <code>code128.png</code>. If you wanted to use a Code39 barcode instead, you'd
      just replace the barcode part:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="ruby">require 'barby'
require 'barby/barcode/code_39'
require 'barby/outputter/png_outputter'

barcode = Barby::Code39.new('I am losing sleep over their racket', true)
File.open('code39.png', 'w'){|f|
  f.write barcode.to_png
}</code></pre>

    <img src="code39.png" alt="Code 39 example" class="barcode" />

    <p>
      Or if you want to create a GIF instead, the <code>RmagickOutputter</code> has that functionality:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="ruby">require 'barby'
require 'barby/barcode/code_128'
require 'barby/outputter/rmagick_outputter'

barcode = Barby::Code128.new('Give the order that suruppu-disease shall break out')
File.open('code128.gif', 'w'){|f|
  f.write barcode.to_gif
}</code></pre>

    <img src="code128b.gif" alt="Code 128 example" class="barcode" />
